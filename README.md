## Design


### Color scheme


The color scheme I developed based on the original image of the logo using [AdobeColor](https://color.adobe.com/create/image).
Afterwards I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to select a matching pallete. 
Also in the final project, some shades of colors from the palette can be used.

To see what  generated color pallete matches best I used  eightshapes.com to generate an accesibility table.

## Fixed Bugs


Form field validation was not performed when the "Submit Message" button was clicked.
After researching, I found that form validation works when using the HTMLButtonElement (represents the ```<button>``` element). Source: [MDN Web Docs](#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation).

To fix this, I replaced the button link tag 

```<div class="btn-submit"><a href="#.html">Send Message!</a></div>```

with the input tag button as shown below.

```<input class="btn-submit" type="submit" value="Send Message!"> ```
